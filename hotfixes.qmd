title: "Releasing Hotfixes"
---

A hotfix is a bug fix for a situation where a bug has been found, but the main
branch has new features that are not yet ready to be released.

Take for example a situation where you want to introduce two new features into
the project, so you create two branches for each of them. You finish the first
and merge it into the main branch and you are still working on the second. Your
Git graph might look something like this:


```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit
    commit tag: "0.14.0"
    branch feature1
    branch feature2
    checkout main
    checkout feature1
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge feature1
    checkout feature2
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
```


Then, you get a report that something is broken and you need to fix it
immediately. If you check out from the main branch you will grab `feature1` as
well, which is not yet ready for production because you intended `feature2` to
be released along side. In this case, you need to create a hotfix, and create
the branch _from the last tag_:

```sh
git switch --detach 0.14.0 # checkout the tag
git switch -c hotfix-branch # create a new branch
# do some work
git commit -m 'hotfix for nn'
git push origin hotfix-branch
```

TBC

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit
    commit tag: "0.14.0"
    branch feature1
    branch feature2
    branch hotfix-branch order: 9
    checkout hotfix
    commit
    commit tag: "0.14.1"
    checkout main
    checkout feature1
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge feature1
    checkout feature2
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge hotfix
```
