# Summary

This book contains behind-the-scenes information, procedural information, and
case studies of issues dealt with. It contains links to documentation that lives
with the packages used by The Workbench, but it is not complete. There are
several areas that are indeed missing and for that I apologise. I hope that this
provides a start for someone who is wondering why The Workbench was designed the
way it was and for insights about some of the processes that go on in building a
lesson.

Thank you for reading.
