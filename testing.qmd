Every single package that runs code in the lesson infrastructure is tested
before it ever reaches any lesson. This is important because we want to give the
lesson authors and maintainers as much freedom as they need to write a lesson
while maintaining predictability and integrity. We also want to give our
community confidence that this system works. 

Whenever a new feature or bug fix is added to The Workbench, it is imperative
that a test is associated and verified before it gets sent into production.

Tests can be run locally and via continuous integration. This page introduces
some of the testing strategies used in The Workbench and the caveats that come
with these strategies.

## Unit Testing

The tests under `test/testthat/` are run in alphabetical order using the
{testthat} package (see https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html) via
`devtools::test()` or `devtools::check()`.

## Continous Integration {#ci}

All the unit tests are run in continuous integration for every push and pull
request that occurs. They also run every week. This provisions the current
releases of the R package dependencies along with development versions of
critical dependencies such as {renv}.

In continous integration, we run on with the following conditions to make sure
it works not only on GitHub, but also on local user machines:

 - test coverage (no package structure) with released versions on Ubuntu Linux
   (though reporting is stalled)
 - For each platform (Ubuntu Linux, macOS, and Windows)
   - `R CMD check`, which checks the structure of the package and documentation
   - all run on these versions of R: current, devel, and two previous R versions

Because of occasional provisioning failures on macOS and Windows, we require
only that Ubuntu Linux latest version passes check for merging pull requests.
