title: "The {varnish} package"
---

## Introduction

The {varnish} package is a weird little package in that it does not contain any
actual R code. It's purpose is to host HTML templates along with the CSS and
JavaScript needed to display the lesson.

We take advantage of the fact that the only thing actually _required_ to install
an R package is the presence of a `DESCRIPTION` file[^1]. These all live inside
the `inst/` folder, which is a place that allows files to be installed along
with the package.

The {pkgdown} package uses this as a mechanism for package developers to
override the default styling, creating customized documentation websites such
as the rOpenSci documentation sites: <https://docs.ropensci.org/rotemplate/>.

This allows people to update the lesson styling however they wish[^2] and while
we _could_ include it in {sandpaper}, it's best kept separate so that people
can update {varnish} without needing to update the entire tool suite.



## Design and Implementation Background

The design for the frontend was [created by Emily de la Mettrie in
2021](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/05/lesson-template-design-process/)
after consultation with Zhian N. Kamvar and Fran√ßois Michonneau using examples
from The Unix Shell and parts of [Exploring Data
Frames](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/05-data-structures-part2.html)
for content cues.

The [final figma design
project](https://www.figma.com/file/rPy9a8ynuitr8UJb3J3g3w/FINAL%2FR2--HANDOFF?type=design&node-id=51-14742&t=9w1bqktQLCi36ctH-0)[^3]
was then handed off to a team at Bytes.co, who translated the designs to CSS and JavaScript, subcontracted an a11y testing company to interactively test the prototype for a11y issues.

The [prototype we recieved from
Bytes.co](https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-bytes.co-staging) was a
Jekyll template serving HTML files. Zhian created [a staging repository called
shellac](https://github.com/zkamvar/shellac) to transform the site from one
that was served via static site generator to one that was standalone. The preview is preserved at <https://zkamvar.github.io/shellac/student_carpentries.html>.

This site was then stripped of the  added into {varnish} in [carpentries/varnish#14](https://github.com/carpentries/varnish/pull/14) between 2022-01-10 and 2022-01-24, when the 1.0.0 release of {varnish} was created and the sandpaper docs
website was updated to use the new version of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


[^1]: for example, a DESCRIPTION file is a low-rent way of specifying
  depedencies for [a
  manuscript](https://github.com/everhartlab/sclerotinia-review-2017)). 
[^2]: There is a caveat, though. There are some components, such as the sidebar
  and overview callouts that are built on the {sandpaper} side and then fed
  into the template.

To preview what it looks like, click the "Present" button (iconized as a triangle play button) in the top right.
