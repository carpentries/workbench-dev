# Preface {.unnumbered}


The Carpentries Workbench is a open-source and portable lesson infrastructure
built with the [R programming language](https://r-project.org). Despite it
being built in R, contributors do not need to know any R in order to use it to
build reliable, stylish, and accessible lessons.

This book serves as development documentation for The Carpentries Workbench.
It was written between June and December 2023 primarily to orient new developers
and contributors to The Workbench ecosystem.
