> Heavy paper coated on one side with sand or other abrasive material and used for smoothing surfaces.


The {sandpaper} package is the user interface for The Carpentries workbench and
orchestrates the building and deployment of lessons, thus it helps lesson
developers, authors, and maintainers to smooth out their contributions. Because
of it's user-facing and modular nature, it is the most complex package in The
Workbench. It has both {pegboard} and {varnish} as dependencies and employs the
following programming techniques:

 - Metaprogramming
 - Function Aliasing
 - Function Factories
 - Subprocessing
 - Lua (language, via pandoc)
 - Logicless Templating (via mustache)
 - XPath
 - System calls (to git)
