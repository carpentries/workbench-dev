title: "Testing {sandpaper}"

## Introduction

{sandpaper} is the largest package and the main user and deployment interface
for The Workbench. The tests are all designed to work within a lesson context,
which means a couple of things to be aware of.

1. **Some tests will take a long time to run.** IO procedures are often one of
   the most time-consuming steps in computing and {sandpaper} does a lot of it.
2. **Most tests will be dependent on the previous tests in a file.** 
   Because the tests work on a folder on disk, we need to provision different
   scenarios of lesson state. It is far simpler to do this by side-effect rather
   than copying, setting up, and tearing down the state of the lesson for each
   and every test.

## Test Setup

There is nothing that you as the contributor/developer need to do to set up for
running these tests beyond what you have already done in [your development
setup](setup.html). This section describes conceptually how {testthat} and
{sandpaper} setup the testing environment after you run `devtools::test()`.

In short, this is the process:

1. {sandpaper} is loaded
2. [Helper test files](#helpers) are loaded
3. The [setup script](#setup-script) is loaded, which provisions the [test 
   lesson](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/reference/fixtures.html)
4. Each test file matching`tests/testthat/test-*.R` is run, resetting the test
   lesson at the top of each file.

### Test Helpers {#helpers}

Sandpaper has three test helpers that handle some of the more tedious
side-effects of testing.

[`helper-hash.R`](https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/blob/HEAD/tests/testthat/helper-hash.R)
: Expectation `expect_hashed()` that an episode file MD5 sum (expected) matches
  the MD5 sum (actual) we recorded in the `site/built/md5sum.txt` database.

[`helper-processing.R`](https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/blob/HEAD/tests/testthat/helper-processing.R)
: Provides an output string that demonstrates a screen output of a file being
  processed by {knitr}. This is used with [`expect_output()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/expect_output.html).

[`helper-snap-transform.R`](https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/blob/HEAD/tests/testthat/helper-snap-transform.R)
: A function that is passed to the transform parameter of
  [`expect_snapshot()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/expect_snapshot.html)
  and will mask the temporary directory path so that the snapshot does not
  continuously invalidate on every run.

### Setup Script {#setup-script}

The first script to run is
[`tests/testthat/setup.R`](https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/blob/HEAD/tests/testthat/setup.R),
where [a test
lesson](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/reference/fixtures.html) and a
local git remote is created and stored in a temporary location for the duration
of the test suite and a reset function is exposed for the tests.
